/// up. An enemy tackles when it lives, is seen, no state of its prevents tackling and, a monster, its monster tackles; the
/// walker escapes when a state of its says it cannot be tackled. The formula is the references' idea (D181), measured on
/// the 3 walks tackled: 3 AP and 2 MP lost of 6 and 3 kept at a half, 2 and 1 of 7 and 4 at two thirds, 1 and 1 of 2 and 4
/// at three quarters, the half rounded up; and on 6 walks that lost nothing, leaving monsters that do not tackle or a lock
/// their dodge outweighs. The server announces the tackle (action 104), then each loss (101 AP, 127 MP).

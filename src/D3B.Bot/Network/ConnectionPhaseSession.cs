/// A frame is logged by the readable fields its oneofs hold, such as <c>request.identification</c>, and its length: never

/// understood whole (D47) is rewritten: its host becomes D3B's address, and its ports the game listener's, the real game
/// server being kept in <see cref="GameServerSelections"/> and the account the identification named in
/// <see cref="GameAccounts"/>, both by the answer's ticket. Any other answer, or one the relay could not hold whole, goes on
/// as it came: the game connection then goes straight to the game server, as before D3B took it.

/// whose connection host is D3B's address, kept in <c>Network:Redirect:Directory</c> (<c>%LOCALAPPDATA%\D3B\client</c> by
/// default); the client gets its own back when the host stops. Each connection phase goes to Ankama's connection host,
/// bytes as they are, both ways, but for the server selection's answer, which sends the client's game connection to D3B;
/// that connection goes to the game server whose ticket it presents (D51 to D53).

/// Requires the protocol module: each frame of the connection phase is decoded through the installed build's translation
/// and logged by what it is, never by what it holds (D49). Each game connection is a <see cref="GameSession"/>: its

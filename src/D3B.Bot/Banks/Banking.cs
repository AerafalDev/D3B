/// and asks its question, offering two replies, one of which the pack lists among the banker's (D29). That reply ends the
/// dialog and opens the exchange with the character's storage in the same millisecond, the opening paid with as many
/// kamas as the storage holds stacks. Stacks go in by one request listing them, the server taking those it may; kamas by
/// another. Leaving ends the exchange, and the client then sends two requests to leave by itself, which the server does
/// not answer. Each answer comes 28 ms after its request.

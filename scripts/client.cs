// [--address <address>]; --help describes the options.
// While D3B's host runs, the client's ConfigUrl names a copy of its configuration that sends it to D3B, and the host gives
// it Ankama's back when it stops. After a crash, restore does that by hand, so that clients play without D3B; the host
// sends them to D3B again at its next start.
// Exit code: 0 when the client can connect, or after a restore; 1 when it is sent to D3B and nothing listens there, or
// Ankama's URL is lost; 2 when the client or its version file cannot be read.

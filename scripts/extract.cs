// Extracts the game data of the installed client into the pack of its build (D10, D24): every map with its cells and
// interactive elements and their graphics, the world graph, the atlas of map positions, sub-areas and their resources, areas
// and zaaps, the items, jobs, skills, interactives and banks, the icons of the items a harvest names and of the
// professions, what fights need (spells and their levels, effects, states, monsters and their grades, breeds and
// characteristics), and the texts these name, in French and English.
// Usage: dotnet run --file scripts/extract.cs -- [--client <dir>] [--output <dir>] [--force] [--level <n>]; --help
// describes the options.
// The pack lands in <output>/<client version>/data-<format>.pack, where the host looks first. It is derived from the
// client, so it is never committed: packs ship as release artifacts (D24).
// Exit code: 0 on success, or when the pack is already up to date; 1 when the extraction failed; 2 when the client is
// missing.

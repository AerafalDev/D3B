// Reads the protocol of the installed client from its IL2CPP code with Cpp2IL (D11, D15) and writes its obfuscated
// schema: every message of Ankama.Dofus.Protocol.Connection and Ankama.Dofus.Protocol.Game, its fields, their numbers and
// types, its oneofs and maps, and the enums, as a protobuf FileDescriptorSet. The metadata gives the structure, and each
// message's machine code the exact encoding of every field, which checks it.
// Usage: dotnet run --file scripts/schema.cs -- [--client <dir>] [--output <dir>] [--proto <dir>]; --help describes the
// options.
// The schema lands in <output>/<client version>/schema-<format>.binpb, beside the build's pack. It is derived from the
// client, so it is never committed: it ships as a release artifact (D11, D24).
// Exit code: 0 on success; 1 when the client's code does not read as protobuf's generated code; 2 when the client is
// missing.

// Publishes the pack, the obfuscated schema and the protocol mapping of a client build as assets of the release
// client-<version> (D24, D33, D50), each with its SHA-256 beside it: the release is created when it does not exist, and
// gains the assets it lacks. A published asset is never replaced. The mapping must hold against the schema, as the host
// requires (D48), before anything is published.
// Usage: dotnet run --file scripts/release.cs -- [--client <dir> | --client-version <version>] [--packs <dir>]
// [--publish]; --help describes the options.
// Without --publish it changes nothing on GitHub: it checks the files, writes their SHA-256 beside them, and says what it
// would run. It runs the GitHub CLI, gh, logged in to an account that can write to the repository.
// Exit code: 0 on success, when the release already holds these files, and after a dry run; 1 when a file is not one to
// publish, the release cannot take it, or gh failed; 2 when the client, the pack, the schema or the mapping is missing.

# Status

Where the project stands, on one page. Read it first: it says what exists, what is not measured, what comes next and what is
owed. The reasons are in [decisions.md](decisions.md), found through [decisions-index.md](decisions-index.md); the steps and
their sessions are in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md); how the code is built is in [architecture.md](architecture.md). Whoever closes
a session updates this page, the roadmap and the index.

As of 2026-11-09, after D398 (D394, session 7d4, merged into 7r2's branch). App 0.8.1, client build 3.7.13.17, pack format 11, mapping format 17, all published.

## What exists

- **A bot that plays through the official client** (D23): the relay between the client and Ankama's servers, the readable
  protocol and its per-build mapping, the data pack extracted from the client (steps 1 to 3).
- **The run time** (step 4): one bot per character, walking, changing maps, using elements, banking, zaaps and the haven bag,
  activities, recovery.
- **Harvesting and the hunt** (steps 6 and 9): both choose their place by the character's levels and go through several
  sub-areas in turn (D391, D392); fights are played by one AI for every breed (D244), with the rules and effects of a fight
  measured on the owner's captures.
- **The desktop app as a studio** (step 7, up to 7d4 and 7r2): dark, docked, seen as a game engine (D397: the world's map is the
  centre, with the characters, routes and zones on it, an Outliner and a Details panel), the project's assets in files,
  behaviors and profiles as variants, the world's map drawn from the client's images, routes with their actions, a profile
  playing a list of routes and steps made in the app (D386), zones painted on the same map (D394), Undo and Redo in the route, the
  list of steps and the profile editors, and rows dragged or moved by the keys (D394).
- **A versioned Claude Code setup** (D398): `.claude/` holds C# hooks that ask before a push or a `gh` write and refuse
  what the client produces, skills for C#, the studio's UI, tests, Git and the rest, and two agents. The hooks are tested in
  `tests/D3B.Hooks.Tests`; the write guard and the Git guard were seen refusing inside a session, the "ask" answers and the
  Stop hook's block not yet.
- **Published**: the installer and updates through Velopack (D171); the client build's pack, schema and mapping as the release
  `client-3.7.13.17` (D365).

## Not measured in game

- The routes' actions that talk to the game and the profiles playing a list of steps (7d3c, 7d3d): tried on the test game
  only; a real client with the owner is to do.
- 7d4's editors (undo, dragging, the zones' tools) are tested on view models and headless windows, not yet by the owner's hand
  in the app: how a drag feels, the focus after a move by the keys, the zones painted at several zooms.
- The owner's reports from game answered since 2026-11-06 (D387 to D392): the hunt attacking every group, the tour leaving
  interiors out, the AI fleeing less, the rotation through ten sub-areas and the professions in turn. The numbers 5, 10, a
  quarter and 50 of D391 and D392 are the lead's reckoning.
- Banking by the general settings (D405): the share of pods and the zaap rule are tested on the fake game and in the app's
  view models. A bank journey that outlives a refused zaap is the lead's reading of a player's report (Incarnam to Astrub, 1,500
  kamas the character lacked), not seen in game; the text the server answers to a zaap that cannot be paid, and the cost of a
  zaap leaving Incarnam's world map, are not measured.
- Step 9's mechanisms: the Roublard against big enemies with `Fights:Alone`, the Féca's glyphs, an Osamodas's summons and the
  fight map's preview, an aggression, stairs and portals, the inactivity popup, what the client shows once its turn's end goes
  unanswered (D367).

## Next

0. **A large refactoring and tidy-up session**, asked by the owner: the code's remaining debt (below), the architecture and
   the docs (`decisions.md` is about 700 KB; `status.md`, `architecture.md` and `client.md` are long). It is a session of
   its own, planned with the owner before it starts; no step of the roadmap is begun in it.
1. **Session 7r3, the Sequencer** (D395, D396, D397): a route's steps set in a ruler of steps with a track a kind of action, a clip
   drawn across the steps it covers, derived from the anchors (`RouteAnchor.Actions` and the file unchanged), the palette in place
   of the dialog, several steps selected at once with the same fields set for all, copy; recording in the toolbar waits for the
   measure in game. The frame it sits in, the world viewport with its Outliner and Details, is made (7r2). Then 7r4 following a
   run, 7r5 the profile's asset editor, 7r6 sequences and laps; all before 7e.
2. **A measure in game with the owner**, before anything else of step 7: the list above, and what 7d4b will record.
3. **Session 7d4b**: recording while playing and Simplify (D299, D394), once the events it reads are measured.
4. **7e and 7e2**: the canvas of behaviors, then 7f to 7i (nodes and planning, debugging, the AI's fight preferences, sharing).
   The breeds, set aside since 9f5, come back once these are done (D306).
5. **Then** step 9's remaining mechanisms, and steps 10 to 13 (several accounts, marketplace and crafting, treasure hunts and
   dungeons, the owner's profession scripts).

The measure in game is worth a session of its own before 7e grows the code further.

## Open questions

Q5 (the fight formulas left: shields, AP and MP removed, erosion), Q12 (what quests, breed and the server's codes gate),
Q16 (casts and walks the server refuses that the rules allow), Q17 (a build that changes its schema). The table is at the end of
[decisions.md](decisions.md#open-questions).

## Known debt

- `D3B.Bot` is about 17,900 lines in 224 files and `D3B.Studio` about 6,300 in 141 (D393). The border is the compiler's, one way:
  `D3B.Studio` references `D3B.Bot`, which knows nothing of it. Left over: `D3B.Studio.Routes` reaches the harvest and the fight
  through `MapHarvest` and `MapFight`, now public, so a module of `D3B.Bot` cannot declare nodes (the node API is the studio's):
  a future module in a project of its own can. Nine members and types of `D3B.Bot` became public so that the studio could use them
  (`BotContext.Actor`, `BotActor.Time`, `Log`, `PauseAfterStep`, `SettingDefinition.TryRead`, `ActivitySettingsBuilder`'s
  constructor and `Build`, `MapHarvest`, `MapFight`): a narrower seam would be a task of its own.
- Files over 900 lines (D399): `FightJudge` 1,357, `RouteEditorViewModel` 1,238, `HarvestActivity` 970, `Imagination` 955 and `WorldMapView` 930. `AssetsViewModel` (885) and `BotActor` (723) are cut. `D3B.Bot` stays one project: its core (`Runtime`, `Activities`, `Banks`, `Movement`, `Journal`, `Characters`) refers to itself both ways, `Harvesting` and `Fighting` are the leaves; `Fighting` reaches into `HarvestActivity.FoodTypes`.
- Undo has two histories: the route editor keeps its own snapshots (D375), the list of steps, the profile and the zone editors use
  `UndoHistory` (D394). Moving the route onto it is a change of no use by itself; do it when the route editor is next opened for another reason.
- The zones are read by nothing yet but `ZoneMaps` and their editor; the nodes and conditions of 7f are the ones to use them.
- `GroupJudge.OddsOf`, `Beats`, `Winnable` and `Share` are called by nothing in `src/` since D387, only by
  `scripts/fights/HuntBench.cs` and their tests. D387 kept them on purpose, for that bench: if the bench is dropped, they go
  with their tests; `Allows` and `Character` are alive.
- `docs/decisions.md` is about 700 KB: read the index and the entries about the area worked on, never the whole file.

# Decisions

Product and architecture decisions, oldest first. Each entry states what was decided, why, and what was rejected. An
entry is never rewritten: a later entry supersedes it, and the old one is marked as superseded. Questions still open
are listed at the end, with the [roadmap](roadmap.md) step that settles them.

Decisions D1 to D18 were taken on 2026-10-27, one by one, after studying the references in `vendor/` and the bots
sold for Dofus 3.

## Brief

Set by the project owner, not up for decision:

- An open-source bot for Dofus 3 (Unity), in .NET 10.
- Better than the existing bots, open source or sold: inspired by them, never copied.
- Every feature is a module, assembled as in Bevy. External .NET plugins add modules.
- The desktop UI is Avalonia with ShadUI.
- The network goes through Kestrel's socket layer.
- Game data is extracted from the official client by file-based apps in `scripts/`, as in Dofus Remastered.
- Fights take their ideas from Bubble emu and BubbleBot, and do everything better.
- Every new large task starts in a new session, closed with a prompt for the next one.

## D1: .NET 10 on Windows

*2026-10-27*

D3B is written in C# on .NET 10 and runs on Windows only.

- **Why.** One runtime for the bot, its tools and its UI. The Unity readers of Dofus Remastered (MIT, same owner) and
  the Cpp2IL and AssetsTools.NET libraries run in process, where BillBot shells out to C# tools from Python. Source
  generators cover the protocol and data code. Async I/O carries many accounts in one process. The official client and
  its launcher are Windows programs.
- **Rejected.**
  - Python, continuing BillBot: its core depends on PyQt6 (11 files of `src/core`), it runs one thread per timer, and
    it has no license.
  - A Linux headless host: no need yet. The host stays free of Windows UI code, so it remains possible.

## D2: What D3B never contains

*2026-10-27*

D3B never contains, in its code, its default modules or its documentation:

- evasion of Ankama's detection: simulated mistakes, timings shaped to avoid bans, forged hardware identifiers;
- mass account creation;
- subscription or payment automation;
- disabling or bypassing Ankama Shield;
- one proxy per account to hide multi-accounting.

- **Why.** These parts exist to defeat Ankama's protections or to run farms at scale, not to play. The references have
  them (BillBot's `fake_bad_*` behaviors and `human_timings`, BubbleBot's `HardwareService`, `AccountCreation*`,
  `Subscribe*`, `ShieldDisable`, `ProxyAssociate`): they are not studied and not reproduced.
- Using any bot on the official servers breaches Ankama's terms of service and can get the account banned. D3B says
  so plainly and does not hide it.

## D3: The references in `vendor/` give ideas, never code

*2026-10-27*

`vendor/` is ignored by Git. What each reference is for:

| Reference | License | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BillBot-master` (Python) | None | Ideas: clean protobuf classes behind a translation layer, the mapping toolkit, the version gate, immutable state snapshots, the debug recorder. Code the owner wrote may be ported. |
| `Bubble.D3.Bot-main` (.NET 9) | GPL-3.0 | Ideas: datacenter reading from the installed client, generated readers, handlers by domain, fight AI by simulation, treasure hunt clue solving. |
| `bubble-emu-v2-develop` (.NET 8) | GPL-3.0 | Ideas for fights. It is a Dofus 2 emulator: its formulas are checked against Dofus 3 before use. |
| `JondoEmu-main` (.NET 10) | None | Ideas: protocol rebuilt from the Cpp2IL dump, anchors named from real captures, structural matching across builds. |
| `dofus-unity-proto-main` | None | Reference for message shapes. |
| `Dofus` (Dofus Remastered) | MIT, same owner | Unity readers copied into `scripts/` (D10), conventions, the Bevy-like plugin model. |
| `metiers` | The owner's | Lua scripts the owner wrote for Snowbot, levelling each profession from 1 to 200. They are the acceptance test of the Lua API (D12). |

- **Why.** Copying GPL code would make D3B GPL (D4). Code with no license cannot be reused at all. BubbleBot's damage
  calculator is a port of Ankama's own client code. Reading for ideas and rewriting keeps D3B clean and lets it fix
  their faults: BubbleBot's shared mutable pathfinder and data races, BillBot's silently dropped fields.

## D4: MIT license, private repository until the first milestone

*2026-10-27*

D3B is published under the MIT license, as Dofus Remastered and Palforge. The repository stays private until the first
milestone (D16).

- **Rejected.**
  - GPL-3.0: it would allow BubbleBot's code, which D3 already rules out.

## D5: Modules assembled as in Bevy, for composition only

*2026-10-27*

A bot application is assembled from modules. A module implements `Build(BotBuilder)` and registers what it brings:
services, message handlers, activities, fight strategies, Lua API namespaces, settings and UI pages. A module may
require other modules; adding a module type twice builds it once. A default group gathers the standard modules
(network, protocol, data, world, movement, harvesting, bank). A plugin is an assembly that contains modules (D6).

The model applies to composition only. At run time each bot is an async actor (D9), not a world of systems run in
phases. `BotBuilder` sits on the .NET Generic Host: the host is a long-running service whose lifetime, configuration,
logging and dependency injection the Generic Host already covers.

- **Rejected.**
  - A Bevy-like run time, with resources, events and systems per bot: a bot reacts to messages and timers, not to
    frames, and async workflows say that more directly.
  - Reusing the core of `Dofus.Framework`: it would first have to be split from SDL in Dofus Remastered, and the two
    projects would be tied together.

## D6: External plugins load once, never unload

*2026-10-27*

An external plugin is a folder under `plugins/`. Each loads into its own `AssemblyLoadContext`, which shares the host's
assemblies, as Palforge's `PluginLoadContext`, but is not collectible. A plugin declares its identity with an
attribute. A `dotnet new` template creates one.

- **Why.** Unloading constrains every type a plugin touches and is rarely needed: updating a plugin restarts the host.
- **Rejected.**
  - Collectible contexts, as in Palforge.
  - Modules compiled into the application only: nobody could add one from outside.
  - NuGet packages or a catalogue in the UI: more work than a folder needs at this stage.

## D7: A headless host runs the bots, the desktop app is its client

*2026-10-27*

The bots run in a headless host. The Avalonia app connects to it over gRPC on a named pipe, served by Kestrel.

- **Why.** A crash or a restart of the UI does not stop the bots. A remote front stays possible later. Kestrel is
  already in the stack (D8).
- The transport, gRPC on a named pipe, is a local and reversible choice.
- **Rejected.**
  - Everything in one process: simpler at first, but the UI's faults would take the bots down.

## D8: The network goes through Kestrel's socket layer, socket mode first

*2026-10-27*

Outgoing connections use `SocketConnectionContextFactory.Create(Socket)`, Kestrel's public API since .NET 7, on a
socket connected by the bot. The MITM mode listens with Kestrel and a connection handler. Both give a
`ConnectionContext`, and the codec only sees its `IDuplexPipe`. Socket mode, with no game client, comes first. The MITM
mode comes later, mainly to capture sessions and debug.

- **Why.** Kestrel's pipes, memory pool and scheduling, with no copy of its internals. One abstraction for both modes.
  An in-memory `Pipe` replaces the network in tests and replays.
- The network project references the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` framework. No other project needs it.
- **Rejected.**
  - A copy of Kestrel's internal socket classes, as in BubbleBot (`Bubble.Core/Network/Transport/Sockets`).
  - `NetworkStream` with pipes on top: workable, but no better than what Kestrel already exposes.

## D9: Each bot is an async actor

*2026-10-27*

Each bot owns one inbox (`Channel<T>`) and processes it on one logical thread, so its state needs no locks. Every
delay goes through `TimeProvider`, so tests control time. Behaviors are async methods taking a `CancellationToken`:
an interruption, such as a fight starting, cancels the current behavior, and a recovery step runs before it resumes.
Logic code reads immutable snapshots of the state, an idea from BillBot.

- **Rejected.**
  - A thread per timer with callbacks, as in BillBot.
  - Mutable flags and an if-chain, as in BubbleBot (about 70 flags in `GameRuntimeState`).
  - Singletons shared between bots: BubbleBot's world pathfinder keeps the search in fields with no lock.

## D10: Game data comes from file-based apps, and ships as packs

*2026-10-27*

Data is extracted from the official client by file-based apps in `scripts/`, with Dofus Remastered's conventions:
they have no tests, and shared code is pulled in through `#:include`. The Unity readers of Dofus Remastered (on
AssetsTools.NET) are copied there, then evolve on their own. The output is packs: MemoryPack serialization,
compressed with zstd. Packs are published as release artifacts, never committed. The scripts stay usable by anyone who
prefers to extract from their own client.

- **Why.** One extraction per client build, by the maintainer, instead of one per user.
- **Risk, accepted by the owner.** Distributing data derived from the client is a legal risk.
- **Rejected.**
  - Each user extracting from their own client only: safer, but every user needs the tools and runs them at every
    update.
  - A library shared with Dofus Remastered: it would tie the release cycles of both projects.
  - JSON in Git LFS (BillBot) or a committed `maps.json` (BubbleBot).

## D11: Bot code sees clean protobuf classes, translated per build by our own pipeline

*2026-10-27*

Messages are C# classes generated from readable `.proto` files, with Google.Protobuf and Grpc.Tools. A mapping per
client build translates the obfuscated wire into these classes and back. A field that is not mapped fails loudly. The
host refuses to start when its mapping does not match the installed client's build.

The mapping comes from our own pipeline: a Cpp2IL dump of the client, the IDA Pro tracer (the owner has IDA), scored
matching, pinned pairs that are versioned, and a contract audit that fails the build. The readable `.proto` files and
the pinned pairs are committed. The mapping of each build ships with that build's data pack (D10). The pipeline takes
its ideas from BillBot (scored matching, pins, audit, version gate, update watcher) and from JondoEmu (anchors from
real captures, structural matching across builds).

- **Rejected.**
  - protobuf-net classes with obfuscated field names in the bot code, as in BubbleBot.
  - Starting from `dofus-unity-proto`: no license.
  - BillBot's translator, which drops unmapped fields silently, and its pins, which each update wipes.

## D12: Lua for routes and routines, .NET plugins for features

*2026-10-27*

Users write routes and routines in Lua. The API is in the family of the Dofus Retro bots and Snowbot: namespaces
called with `:` (`global`, `map`, `inventory`, `npc`, `job`, `exchange`, `character`), and a script defines `move()`
and `bank()`, which the bot calls. Every commercial Dofus 3 bot studied offers this. The owner's profession scripts
(`vendor/metiers`) must run once adapted to it: that is the API's acceptance test, at the end of the roadmap.
Features are .NET plugins (D6). The Lua engine is LuaCSharp: pure C#, with async calls, so `move()` awaits without
blocking. A prototype confirms it first (Q1).

- **Rejected.**
  - Plugins only: users would have to code and compile.
  - Profiles in the UI only: too limited.
  - MoonSharp, no longer maintained, and NLua, native and without async calls.

## D13: Fights run on a simulator of our own

*2026-10-27*

Fights are decided by simulating candidate actions and scoring them. The idea comes from BubbleBot, which scores cells
per spell. The simulator is written from the spell effects in the game data, not ported from Ankama's code or from GPL
code. Bubble emu informs the mechanics: its formulas are Dofus 2, so each is checked against Dofus 3 (Q5). Fight
strategies, per class or per build, are modules.

- **Rejected.**
  - A greedy choice of the best-weighted action, as in BillBot, which detects life steal through the French word
    "vol" in the effect text.

## D14: Avalonia and ShadUI, in French and English

*2026-10-27*

The desktop app uses Avalonia 12, ShadUI and CommunityToolkit.Mvvm. Views stay thin, so ShadUI, still at 0.x, can
change without rewriting them. Translation is built in from the start, in French and English. The pages of the first
version: accounts and profiles, the live map with the bot's state, and logs with a protocol inspector.

- **Rejected.**
  - A web dashboard: it would allow control from a phone, but the owner chose a desktop app. The host (D7) keeps a web
    front possible.

## D15: The rest of the stack

*2026-10-27*

Versions are the latest stable on NuGet on 2026-10-27, unless the line says otherwise.

| Area | Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host | Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting | Lifetime, configuration, logging and dependency injection for a long-running service. |
| HTTP (Haapi authentication) | `IHttpClientFactory`, Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience 10.11.0 | Standard retries and timeouts. |
| Protobuf | Google.Protobuf 3.36.2, Grpc.Tools 2.85.0 | Generated at build from `.proto` files; the descriptors give the per-build translation its tables. |
| IL2CPP dump | Samboy063.Cpp2IL.Core 2022.1.0-pre-release.21 | In process. The prerelease JondoEmu uses: the last stable release dates from 2022. |
| Unity data | AssetsTools.NET 3.0.5 | The version Dofus Remastered uses. |
| Data packs | MemoryPack 1.21.4, ZstdSharp.Port 0.8.8 | Generated binary serialization; ZstdSharp is already in Dofus Remastered. |
| Pathfinding | `PriorityQueue`, our own code | No library needed. |
| Scripts | LuaCSharp 0.5.8 | D12. |
| Storage | Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite 10.0.14 | Accounts, profiles and statistics, with migrations. |
| Secrets | ASP.NET Core Data Protection | Already in the framework the network references; DPAPI on Windows. |
| Logs | Serilog.Extensions.Hosting 10.0.0, Serilog.Sinks.File 7.0.0 | Structured, with the bot's id as a property; an in-memory sink feeds the UI. |
| UI | Avalonia 12.1.4, ShadUI 0.2.4, CommunityToolkit.Mvvm 8.4.2 | D14. |
| Map view | An Avalonia control drawing with `DrawingContext` | Enough for cells, entities and paths. |
| Notifications | Discord webhooks through `HttpClient` | One POST, no library. |
| Tests | xunit.v3 4.0.2, CsCheck 5.0.0, Verify.XunitV3 33.3.4, Microsoft.Extensions.TimeProvider.Testing 10.11.0 | As in Dofus Remastered, with property tests for pathfinding and line of sight, and snapshots of replayed sessions. |
| Benchmarks | BenchmarkDotNet 0.15.8 | Codec and pathfinding. |
| Build | Central package management, `Directory.Build.props`, warnings as errors, MinVer 8.0.0, GitHub Actions on Windows | Dofus Remastered's conventions. |
| Distribution | Velopack 1.2.161 | Installer and updates, later. |

No Native AOT: EF Core and the Lua engine do not suit it, and a bot does not need it.

## D16: The first milestone is harvesting and banking

*2026-10-27*

The first milestone: one account, in socket mode, harvests and banks its resources, controlled from the desktop app's
first pages (D14). The repository may go public once it is reached (D4).

- **Rejected.**
  - Fights first: they need the simulator (D13), a larger step.
  - Treasure hunts first: they need clue data and more of the world.

## D17: One large task per session, documents in Markdown

*2026-10-27*

The working agreement of Dofus Remastered applies, as written in `CLAUDE.md`: one roadmap step per session, one branch
and one pull request per session, a task is done with its tests, and each session closes with a report and a prompt
for the next one. Documents are Markdown files in `docs/`.

- **Rejected.**
  - A documentation site, as Palforge's: premature before there is anything to document for users.

## D18: The project is named D3B

*2026-10-27*

The project, its solution and its namespaces are named D3B (`D3B.*`).

## Open questions

Settled questions leave this table, and the decision that settles one says so.

| Id | Question | Settled in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q1 | Does LuaCSharp hold up: sandboxing, async calls, errors, performance? | Step 7 |
| Q2 | How does the per-build translation work: rewriting field numbers on the wire, or decoding twice? | Step 3 |
| Q3 | What does socket mode need to log in? If any part of the handshake would defeat an integrity check of the client, that part is out of scope (D2) and logging in goes through MITM mode instead. | Step 3 |
| Q4 | Where are data packs hosted, and how does the host fetch the pack matching the installed client's build? | Step 2 |
| Q5 | Which fight formulas of Bubble emu (Dofus 2) still hold in Dofus 3? | Step 9 |
| Q6 | What is a plugin's UI part: an assembly loaded by the desktop app, with which contract? | Step 5 |
| Q7 | How are sessions captured and replayed for tests: format, and from which mode? | Step 3 |
